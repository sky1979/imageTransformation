# imageTransformation

     This code was based on the project "PhotoDemon" (http://photodemon.org/) The source code I used is at: https://github.com/tannerhelland/PhotoDemon
     I implemented the algorythim it uses to disort an image using the edges 4 points.
     I translated it from VB6 to C#.
     This is a first draft, there is much improvement to be done, that's why I wanted to opensource it.
     I have found other implementations on C# but none of them were fast or with high quality.
     I used ImageMagick (https://magick.codeplex.com/) in c# when I needed to do this sort of 4 points distort with perspective but I didn't like the fact that I had all the overhead, that's where I found "PhotoDemon" and I loved the project and the distort algorythim.
     I hope this helps somebody else.
